The Pivot is the first project in Module 3 at the Turing School. Each group is given a legacy project to work with. The intent of the project is to simulate the professional challenges of inheriting an imperfect code base and pivoting to a complete different concept.

The goal of this project is to turn the original project, (Outfitters) [], into a multi-tenancy site for short-term lodging rentals. We drew on Airbnb for design and feature inspiration.
