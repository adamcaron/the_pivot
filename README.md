The Pivot is the first project in Module 3 at the [Turing School] (http://turing.io/). Each group is given a legacy project to work with. The intent of the project is to simulate the professional challenges of inheriting an imperfect code base and pivoting to a complete different concept.

The original project, [Endangerous Outfitters] (http://endangerousoutfitters.herokuapp.com/), was a single platform e-commerce company offering luxury tour guide services. We turned Endangerous Outfitters into [Way Out There] (http://way-out-there.herokuapp.com), a multi-tenancy site for short-term lodging rentals. We drew on Airbnb for design and feature inspiration.
